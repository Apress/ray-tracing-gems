Requirements for 64-bit Windows:

* OptiX version 4.0+
* GPU, driver, and CUDA toolkit supported by OptiX, as specified in the OptiX Release Notes
* Microsoft Visual Studio: either VS 2013 for CUDA 7.5, or VS 2015 for CUDA 8
* CMake (http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html).

Instructions for building:

  * Start up cmake-gui from the Start Menu.

  * Select the local directory from optix_advanced_samples as the source file location.

  * Create a build directory that isn't the same as the source directory. 
    Hint: if you type in the directory instead of using the "Browse Build..." button, 
    CMake will prompt to create the directory if it doesn't already exist.

  * Press "Configure" button and select the version of Visual Studio you wish to
    use.  Note that the 64-bit compiles are separate from the 32-bit compiles
    (e.g. look for "Visual Studio 12 2013 Win64").  Leave all other options on
    their default.  Press "OK".

  * Set OptiX_INSTALL_DIR to wherever you installed OptiX, e.g., 
    "C:\ProgramData\NVIDIA Corporation\OptiX SDK <version>\".

  * The newly added OptiX Introduction examples add a dependency for the DevIL image library.
    Set IL_INCLUDE_DIR, IL_LIBRARIES, ILU_LIBRARIES, and ILUT_LIBRARIES to the path for 
    DevIL/include, DevIL.lib, ILU.lib and ILUT.lib respectively.
    
  * Press "Configure" again, then "Generate".

  * Open the OptiX-Advanced-Samples.sln solution file in the build directory you created.

  * Select "Build Solution" from the IDE.

  * Right click on one of the sample program targets in the solution explorer and
    select "Set as start up project".

  * Run the sample.  "q" or "Esc" will close the window.

Note that due to the way dependencies are automatically handled for CUDA
compilation in Visual Studio, if you build again Visual Studio will likely ask
you to reload your projects.  Please do so.  Subsequent compiles should not
result in reloading unless you change the files that are included by a CUDA
file.
